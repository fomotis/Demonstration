# What about Collaboration? (Understanding Branches)

`Git branches` provides a framework for several people to work on the same project and file `r emo::ji("smiling_face_with_sunglasses")`

* Let us begin with the `BBNAIJA` project (close the current project and do the following in a fresh `RStudio session`);

    + Get an invitation to collaborate on a GitHub repo. (You are all being invited to the `BBNAIJA` project)

    + Clone the repo by copying the `SSH` or `https` link and running **git pull SSH/https_link** in your `RStudio` terminal.

    + Type **git checkout -b branch_name** in the `Terminal` to create your branch.
    
    + Use **git checkout branch_name** to switch between branches.
    
    + use **git commit** as usual
     
    + use **git push origin branch_name** to push to your branch.
    
    + use **git pull origin friend_branch_name** to pull changes your friend's changes.

# Introducing The BBNAIJA Project

* The project aims at the following;
    - extract data about BBANIJA from a social-media platform.
    - tidy and explore this data
    - predict chances of nominated housemates getting evicted using machine learning
    - write reports and build deliverables about this
    
* There is an `index.Rmd` file in the `BBNAIJA` repo you cloned which we will all be working on over the next few weeks.

  - You will all be divided into groups and each group will be working on different sections after the next set of lessons (`tidyverse` & `twitteR`)

* `r emo::ji("warning")` Don't merge your pull requests for the `BBNAIJA` projects, there is a special admin (`Abel`) to do that.
